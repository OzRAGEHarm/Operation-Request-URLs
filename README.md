# Operation-Request-URLs
This Repository documents all Operation Request URLs for the EpicResearch Repository so people do not have to do it themselves. If the 'wex' operations do not work, its because of 'client' in the URL.

## Some operations have multiple Compatible profiles and Supported MCPs

## All credit goes to MixV2 and the people that helped with the [EpicResearch](https://github.com/MixV2/EpicResearch) repository.
